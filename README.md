On this page you will find notes and code that I am writing to learn, and help teach, mathematics. 

### Example :abacus: :robot:
I have written code to generate ASCII art depictions of computations done with Turing machines.
  - An example of a complete computation can be found [here](https://github.com/epicurithmetic/turingMachine/blob/master/tm-output.txt). 
  - The code for generating the art can be found [here](https://github.com/epicurithmetic/turingMachine). 
  - These computations can now be represented using [.gif](https://github.com/epicurithmetic/turingMachine/blob/master/images/kiaora.gif)

### :computer: Work Summary - Mathematics Teacher

Currently I enjoy thinking about and teaching the formal mathematics that has grown out of [Hilbert's Program](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hilbert-program/) and the philosophical debates surrounding the program. 
The idea of "proofs-as-programs" is of particular interest to me now. To this end I am learning about:
  - Type Theory
  - Proof assistants
  - Haskell 

When I was a grad-student I worked on the arithmetic geometry of semirings: thinking about how the work of Alexander Grothendick could be extended beyond the category of rings to the category of semirings i.e. algebras/schemes over the natural numbers. My advisor and I formulated Grothendieck's theory of the fundamental group for schemes over semirings. As a result we were able to calculate the fundamental group of the (spectrum of the) natural numbers - it's the trivial group. My thesis can be found [here](https://github.com/epicurithmetic/arithmetic/blob/master/RCullingPhD2019_final_.pdf).
