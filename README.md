:computer: When I am working I teach mathematics.

I enjoy thinking about and teaching the formal mathematics that has grown out of Hilbert's Program. 
The idea of "proofs-as-programs" is of particular interest to me now. I see this is a continuation of the constructive school of thought in the philosophy of mathematics.

I am currently learning about proof assistants, type theory, and Haskell. 


On this page you will find notes and code that I am writing to learn, and help teach, topics in formal mathematics. 

:abacus: :robot: For example I have written code to generate ASCII art depictions of computations done with Turing machines.
  - An example of a complete computation can be found [here](https://github.com/epicurithmetic/turingMachine/blob/master/tm-output.txt). 
  - The code for generating the art can be found [here](https://github.com/epicurithmetic/turingMachine).
